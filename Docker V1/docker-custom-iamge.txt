[//] Build And Test Own Custom Image :-

1. First Wrtite All Logics in any programing language

2. Create A Docker File with any extention -> Dockerfile. It should have to root folder . See Docker-Tut Folder

3. To Create an applcation , u need an base iamge. On particualr os we wan to run this applcation

    FROM node  -> This file denote which type of iamge we nedd to build my custom Image

    COPY index.js /home/app/script.js  -> This command denote copy index.js to /home/app/script.js

4 . To Start Build iamge -> docker build -t mycustomimg .

** .  -> it means current directory

5. docker run  -it mycustomimg bash -> it start a container with the help of custom image

6. To Run a command automatically ..  CMD ["node", "/home/app/script.js"]


[//] Port Mapping :-

1. Create A normal Express App with package.json

2. Configure Dokcerfile --

FROM node

COPY index.js /home/app/index.js            --> Copy indx.js
COPY package.json /home/app/package.json    --> Copy  package.json

WORKDIR /home/app                           --> Set The Working directory . All the comamnd  will run in this directory

RUN npm install                             --> Install Dependices form package.json

CMD ["node", "index"]                       --> When Image start index.js will run




3. Build The Image --

docker build -t node-demo .                 --> node-demo will be the iamge name

Now when server started in conainer , supose it run on port 3001 , the app will not run on our port 3001, because that port
is conainerize in this particualr image

** If want to expose the port from the image 

* Run The Coaniner with Below comamnd :-

docker run -it -p 8000:3001 node-app

-p -> Port maping

Explain -- Hey Docker Run a conainer form node-app iamge interactive mode and make sure do a port 
mapping that inside the docker , it is port 3001 (Right side port number) to my machine port 8000 ( Left Side Port Number)


[//] Autoamtic Port Mapping :-

To Remeber Port for Expose is hectic, so insted of rembering we add in Dockerfile configuration

........

RUN npm install   

EXPOSE 3000-3999           --> Expose all port between range 3000 and 3999

CMD ["node", "index"] 


* Run The Coaniner with Below comamnd :-

docker run -it -P node-app 

It will assign a port by autoamtically , and it is shown under Port Tab in Docker ui


[//] Pushing My Custom Image to Docker Hub  :-

1. Create Docker Account

2. Log in from terminal

3. Create A new Repo in Docker Web App

4. Tage the iamge with repo name, so it wont conflit with other iamge -> docker tag < iamge name> <repo name> . It will create a new iamge in host machine

5. Now push that iamge. docker push < iamge name with tag >
