** [/] docker netwok ls  --> To list all netwok device

** [/] docker netwok inspect bridge --> To get More Information about Bridge Network

** [/] docker run -itd --name spiderman --rm busybox  -- Create A Busybox Conatiner with name spiderman

[//] Bridge Netwok --
                   A host machine have a netwok interface cared. This interface card connect with router. Thus how a host machine have internet access 

Now when we install docker engine in our host machine docker engine create a new network interface, this interface with connect with router. When we create a conainer
those container connect with docker netwok interface with bridge netwok by default

This is a completely isolated from our host machine. We can not ping host machine to a conatiner by default

** Bridge Netwok is two type

          1. Default Bridge
          2. User Defined Bridge Network --> 
                                            To Create Own network , run --> [/] docker network create milkyway


milkyway network will be create type of Bridge Netwok, it means a new netwok interface will be created which name is milkyway
    ** To Specfiy netwok when create a conainer  --> [/] docker run -itd  --network milkyway --name thor --rm busybox
  
** milkyway network interface will be isolated form other network interface

** We can also connect other container from differnt newtwok interface in to user defined bridge network  --> [/] docker newtwok connect milkyway ironamn
                                                                                                  ( milkyway is a user defined newtwok and ironamn is a conainer)




** A container can also connect with multipale newtwok interface




[//] Host Network -- 

      To connect a docker container with a host machine

      --> [/] docker run -itd --name containerA --netwok host busybox

** There are no port mapping
** To Check its working or not --> [/] docker newtwok inspect host

we can find container list object below


[//] Overlay Newtwork -- 
                Overlay Newtwork connect multipale Docker daemons together and enabled swarm service to communicate each other


[//] ipvlan Netwok --
                IPvlan newtwok gives users total control over both ipv4 and ipv6 addressing


[//] macvlan Netwok --
                Macvlan networks allow you to assign a MAC address to a conainer, making it appear as a physical device. Create A conatiner to machine


[//] none Netwok --
                Diabled All Netwroking --> [/] docker run -it --newtwok none busybox
