Scenario :- Supose Developer A working a projct. His machine Config are : node 18 , monogdb , Ubuntu. Now Developer B join the team and started working on the same projct, but he have 
node 16 , postgres , windows 10. So Developer B when try run the projct he get error. Developer B also work on other project . For those projct he need node 16. So he cant upgrade to node 18

              Problem Trying to Solve - 1. Everry Developer in the team must have the same configuration
                                        2. You need to replicate your dev env to the production sever to ensure
                                            smooth operation
